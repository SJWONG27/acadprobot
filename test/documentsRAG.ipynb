      "MASTER OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY)   IMPORTANT NOTES ON  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY COURSE AND DISSERTATION COURSE    Research Methodology course (WOX7001):   •  Students are required to register for the Research Methodology course in their first semester.    Dissertation course (WOC7024 for intake Sem 1 2023/2024 onwards; WOC7021 for intake  2021/2022 and 2022/2023):  •  Registration of Dissertation course  o  Students can only start to register to take the Dissertation course if they have fulfilled  the following pre-requisite of the Dissertation course:  ▪  Have passed any two courses (6 credits) (excluding language courses).  ▪  Have taken or taking WOX7001 Research Methodology.  o  After registering to take the Dissertation course for the first time, a student has to  register for the Dissertation course in every subsequent semester as long as he/she  has not submitted the final dissertation for Senate approval, or he has not obtained  approval from the faculty for withdrawing from the programme for that semester.  o  Before register to take the Dissertation course, the students who are going to take other  courses in the semester should think about whether they can cope with conducting  research for the dissertation while taking other courses.    •  Appointment of Dissertation Supervisor   o  Students must appoint supervisor for their dissertations in the first semester they  register for the Dissertation course.   o  The “Appointment of Supervisor Form” (which includes a tentative dissertation  topic/title agreed by the supervisor) should be submitted to the faculty’s Postgraduate  Office by the stipulated deadline (which is usually no later than the 7th week of a  semester).   o  A student must get the respective supervisor’s approval and signature before  emailing the “Appointment of Supervisor Form” to the faculty’s Postgraduate Office  staff, Mrs. Rohani Mohamed Arifin (ani_e@um.edu.my). The email must be cc’ed to  the supervisor to keep the\n",
      "\n",
      "•  Dissertation Title  o  Have to choose a dissertation title to work on.  o  The dissertation titles can be proposed by the lecturers or students.  o  Titles proposed by lecturers  ▪  Will be published at the start of each semester.   ▪  Two types of titles:  •  Vetted titles – titles with description and had been vetted by the title  vetting committee.  •  Potential titles – titles without description and had not been vetted by  the title vetting committee.  o  Titles proposed by students  ▪  The student has to discuss his/her title with the respective SE lecturer and  prepare a description of the title by filling up the MSE(ST) Dissertation Title  Form with the help of the supervisor.  ▪  The supervisor will submit the MSE(ST) Dissertation Title form to the  MSE(ST) coordinator who will pass it to the vetting committee to get  feedback.  o  An MSE(ST) dissertation MUST has some SE RESEARCH element and is not merely  software development.  o  For cross-disciplinary research, the main supervisor must be a lecturer from the  Department of Software Engineering, and a co-supervisor from another department  can be appointed, if necessary, subjected to the faculty’s approval.  o  Detailed information about how to propose a dissertation title can be found in MSE(ST)  Dissertation Title Form.  o  Other important information on dissertation titles can be found at  https://fsktm.um.edu.my/postgraduate. Look for “Thesis/Dissertation”, “MSE  Dissertation Titles”.    •  Obtaining ethics clearance/approval for research involving human participants and/or animals.  o  Ethics clearance/approval from University of Malaya Research Ethics Committee  (UMREC) is to be obtained before a research project starts. Researchers should  not approach or recruit participants or collect data for any purpose (including pilot  study) prior to receiving ethics approval.  o  UMREC will take about 30 to 60 days to process your application after the submission  deadline. Required amendments will\n",
      "\n",
      "require additional processing time.   o  Only 70 new applications will be accepted every month. Therefore, submit early as  acceptance for the particular month will be based on a first-come, first-served basis.  o  Refer to UMREC website (https://umresearch.um.edu.my/research-ethics/) for ethics  application form, other required forms, guidelines and submission deadlines.    •  Proposal Defence (PD) and Candidature Defence (CD) for dissertation  o  The students are strongly advised to conduct their PD in the 1st semester they  registered for the Dissertation course and to conduct their CD in the 2nd semester  they registered for the Dissertation course.   o  Failing CD twice will cause a student’s candidature to be terminated.  o  PD/CD has to be conducted during REMOS (REsearch MOnitoring Symposium).   o  REMOS is organized every month except for certain months (February and  September). The REMOS dates for the whole year will be emailed to the MSE  students mailing list by the faculty/coordinator.  o  The deadline to register to conduct PD/CD in a particular month is different every  month and will be emailed to the MSE students mailing list by the faculty in each  month.  o  The students are responsible for monitoring their siswa email accounts to check on  the relevant emails.    •  Submission of Dissertation for Examination  o  Students cannot submit their dissertations for examinations if their CGPA is below 3.0  or if they have not completed Part 1 (Coursework). In other words, the students have  to pass all the required courses (core and elective) and obtain a CGPA of 3.0 and  above before they can submit their dissertations for examination.  o  The deadlines to submit dissertations for examination and final dissertations are  different in each semester and will be announced by the university/faculty. The  students are responsible for monitoring their siswa email accounts to check on the  relevant emails.    •  Keeping abreast of information related to\n",
      "\n",
      "supervisor informed.  o  Take note that the “Appointment of Supervisor Form” requires a tentative dissertation  title to be stated. The tentative title can be a title that has been vetted, or a title  that has not yet been vetted by the title vetting committee but has been agreed  by the supervisor.  It is STRONGLY advisable to get the title to be vetted by the  title vetting committee to get feedback to improve the title at an early stage,  before the student starts to work on the title. The vetting can help to identify  problems with the title proposed (such as no SE research element, scope is too  big, etc.) which if not been resolved may result in the student failing the  proposal defence/candidature defence/the dissertation or not able to complete  the dissertation successfully.   o  The “Appointment of Supervisor Form” can be found at  https://fsktm.um.edu.my/postgraduate. Look for “DOWNLOAD”, “Forms and  Template”, “Registration of Dissertation/Research Project”, “Master by Coursework  and Dissertation”.  o  If a student has registered for the Dissertation course but has not appointed a  supervisor for his/her dissertation, the student will not be able to submit  his/her Progress Report for Dissertation. See next paragraph.    •  Submission of Progress Report for Dissertation  o  If a student has registered to take the Dissertation course in a particular semester,  he/she has to submit the Progress Report for Dissertation for that semester via the  Maya system.  o  The deadline to submit the Progress Report is different in each semester and will be  announced by the university/faculty. The students are responsible for monitoring their  siswa email accounts to check the email regarding the deadline and have to submit  their Progress Report before the deadline.   o  Students who did not submit the Progress Report by the deadline will obtain  “Unsatisfactory” for their Dissertation for that semester. This will affect renewal  of visa for international students.\n"
